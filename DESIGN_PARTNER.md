**DriftTrace Design Partner Program****DriftTrace is opening a limited design partner program for organizations building autonomous AI agents.****The Opportunity****Autonomous agents increasingly perform multi step reasoning and tool execution.****Current systems detect failure after execution.****DriftTrace enforces behavioral alignment before tool execution.****What We Offer****• Runtime behavioral drift scoring****• Real time ALLOW or BLOCK enforcement****• Zero modification to foundation models****• Drop in gateway architecture****What We Are Looking For****Design partners willing to:****• Integrate DriftTrace in a staging agent environment****• Provide real agent execution traces****• Validate enforcement thresholds****• Co design runtime governance policies****Expected Outcome****• Reduced risk of unintended tool execution****• Early detection of reasoning deviation****• Structured runtime telemetry for governance****If your organization is building or deploying agentic workflows and interested in runtime enforcement, we invite a focused technical discussion.**
